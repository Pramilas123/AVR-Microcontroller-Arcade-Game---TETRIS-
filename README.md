# AVR-Microcontroller-Arcade-Game---TETRIS-
This project is a hardware-based implementation of the classic Tetris arcade game using an AVR microcontroller (ATmega328p). It showcases the design and development of an embedded gaming system integrating multiple embedded system concepts such as UART communication, GPIO handling, timers, interrupts, and external memory access. The game is visually represented on an 8x8 LED matrix, controlled via the MAX7219 display driver IC, and supported by a 7-segment display to show the current score and random values.

The game initializes by displaying the Tetris logo and generates Tetrimino blocks using a second microcontroller acting as a random number generator (RNG). Communication between the player MCU and RNG MCU is established using serial UART, where the player MCU requests random numbers to determine which shape should fall next. The game includes full control functionality with five push buttons to move pieces left or right, rotate them, accelerate their descent, or reset the game. Players score points by completing horizontal lines, which are then erased in real-time, with the game increasing in difficulty as the score rises.

All development was done in Microchip Studio, and the system was validated and tested using Proteus simulation software. The modular code uses custom libraries for LED and 7-segment control. This project is a demonstration of both creative embedded design and solid engineering practices suitable for real-time applications in interactive systems.
